Stock market analysis using R, excel and tableau
In this project, I used CRSP data from 2010 to 2021 on a monthly basis for different companies. 
Cleaned the data using R and removed the unnecessary entries. After cleaning the data, I found top 20 companies based on market cap and visualized the result using tableau.
Calculated montly value weighted mean for the data and found corealtion between other companies. Based on the result, user can decide whether to invest in such broad stock portfolios.
Analyzed the ZHVI home index data for Boston and visualized the result using tableau for subprime crisis period.
